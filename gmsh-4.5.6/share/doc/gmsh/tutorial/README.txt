This directory contains the Gmsh tutorial.

The `.geo' files are written in Gmsh's built-in scripting language. You can open
them directly with the Gmsh app: in the graphical user interface (GUI), just go
to `File->Open', select e.g. the first tutorial (`t1.geo') and choose "Open"; on
the command line, run "gmsh t1.geo" (which will launch the GUI) or "gmsh t1.geo
-2" (to perform 2D meshing in batch mode).

 * Binary versions of the Gmsh app for Windows, Linux and macOS can be
   downloaded from http://gmsh.info. Several Linux distributions also ship the
   Gmsh app. See the top-level `README.txt' file in the Gmsh source code for
   instructions on how to compile the app from source.

The `c++', `c', `python' and `julia' subdirectories contain C++, C, Python and
Julia versions of (some of) these tutorials, written using the Gmsh Application
Programming Interface (API): you will need the Gmsh dynamic library and the
associated header files (for C++ and C) or modules (for Python and Julia) to run
them. Each subdirectory also contains additional information on how to run the
tutorials for each supported language, as well as extended tutorials (starting
with `x') introducing features available through the API but not available in
`.geo' files.

 * A binary Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows, Linux and macOS, that
   contains the dynamic Gmsh library and the associated header and module files,
   can be downloaded from http://gmsh.info. Several Linux distributions also
   ship the Gmsh SDK. See the top-level `README.txt' in the Gmsh source code for
   instructions on how to compile the dynamic Gmsh library from source.
